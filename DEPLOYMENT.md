# Deployment Information

## 🚀 Active Hosting Platform

**Netlify** is the primary hosting platform for this website.

- **Live URL**: https://mind-studio.netlify.app
- **CMS**: https://mind-studio.netlify.app/admin/
- **Auto-deploy**: Enabled (deploys on every push to main branch)

## ⚠️ GitHub Pages - DISABLED

GitHub Pages has been disabled for this repository. We use Netlify instead because:

✅ Better CMS integration  
✅ Automatic builds  
✅ Better performance  
✅ Free SSL  
✅ Custom domains  

## 📝 How to Disable GitHub Pages Completely

If you still see GitHub Pages errors:

1. **Go to GitHub Repository Settings:**
   ```
   https://github.com/VinniWe/mind-studio-website/settings/pages
   ```

2. **Under "Source":**
   - Select **"None"** from the dropdown
   - Click **"Save"**

3. **Done!** GitHub Pages will stop trying to build

## 🔧 Repository Purpose

This GitHub repository is now used **only** for:
- ✅ Version control
- ✅ CMS backend (stores content files)
- ✅ Collaboration
- ❌ NOT for hosting (that's Netlify's job)

## 📊 Workflow

```
CMS Edit → Git Push → Netlify Build → Live Website
```

1. Edit content in CMS
2. Changes saved to Git
3. Netlify detects push
4. Netlify builds & deploys
5. Changes live in 1-2 minutes!

---

**All deployments happen through Netlify, not GitHub Pages.**
